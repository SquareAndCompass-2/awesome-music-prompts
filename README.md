Welcome to the "Awesome Music Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the [MusicLM](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/experiments/music-lm) model.

## What is MusicLM?

> [MusicLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/) is an experimental technology that allows you to generate your own synthetic music for inspiration. Certain queries that mention specific artists or include vocals will not be generated. 

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Claude. We hope you find these prompts useful! And we encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/yzfly/awesome-music-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list.


## Prompts

```
Sad and longing. The melody is slow and wistful creating a sense of melancholy and nostalgia. Simple arrangement on the piano. 
```

```
Optimistic melody about the arrival of spring, full of joy and hope, tranquil flute in the background, upbeat with a gentle guitar riff
```

```
A jazzy piece with a smooth saxophone solo. The sound is both sophisticated and playful with a slow tempo.
```

```
Songs that would play in a poolside party with light summer vibes
